                <h2>Feathered Dinosaurs</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that some dinosaurs may have had feathers dates back to the 19th century, but it gained significant traction with the discovery of Archaeopteryx in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx, often referred to as a "transitional fossil," had both bird-like features (such as feathers and a wishbone) and reptilian features (such as teeth and a long, bony tail), providing early evidence of the link between dinosaurs and birds. In recent years, even large theropod dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex have been found to have had feathers or feather-like structures during certain stages of their development. This challenges the popular image of these dinosaurs as completely scaled. The presence of feathers in large theropods suggests that feathers were likely widespread among dinosaurs and may have served various functions beyond flight.

                <h2>Wishbones</h2>
                <p>
                    The wishbone, scientifically known as the furcula, is a unique bone found in birds that plays a crucial role in their flight apparatus. The wishbone is formed by the fusion of the clavicles (collar bones) in birds, creating a V-shaped structure located between the sternum and the shoulder joints. The wishbone serves as a site for the attachment of flight muscles and helps to stabilize the shoulder joint during flight movements.

                <h2>Wishbones In Birds vs Dinosaurs</h2>
                <p>
                    In modern birds, the wishbone is a well-developed bone that contributes to their ability to fly. It provides structural support and serves as an attachment point for flight muscles, helping to transmit forces generated by wing flapping during flight.

                    The wishbone is not exclusive to birds; it has also been found in certain dinosaur fossils, particularly theropods, which are a group of bipedal, mostly carnivorous dinosaurs. In some theropod dinosaurs, such as Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx, fossils have been discovered with a furcula-like structure, indicating that these dinosaurs possessed a wishbone-like bone similar to that of birds.

                <h2>Theropods</h2>
                <p>
                    Theropods are characterized by having three primary toes on each foot. These toes are typically arranged in a manner where the innermost toe (digit I) is the smallest, while digits II and III are larger and more robust. This arrangement is often referred to as the "tridactyl" condition, meaning three toes.
                    Birds are considered living descendants of theropod dinosaurs. This means that birds share a common ancestor with dinosaurs, specifically within the group of theropods. By classifying birds as theropod dinosaurs, scientists recognize that birds are not just distant relatives of dinosaurs but are actually members of the dinosaur lineage.
