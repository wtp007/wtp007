    <title>Linking Birds and Dinosaurs</title>
    <article>
        <h1>Feathered Dinosaurs</h1>
        <p>The idea that some dinosaurs may have had feathers dates back to the 19th century, 
            but it gained significant traction with the discovery of Archaeopteryx in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx, 
            often referred to as a "transitional fossil," had both bird-like features 
            (such as feathers and a wishbone) and reptilian features (such as teeth and a long, bony tail), 
            providing early evidence of the link between dinosaurs and birds.</p>
