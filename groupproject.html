    <title>Linking Birds and Dinosaurs</title>
    <article>
        <h1>Feathered Dinosaurs</h1>
        <p>The idea that some dinosaurs may have had feathers dates back to the 19th century, 
            but it gained significant traction with the discovery of Archaeopteryx in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx, 
            often referred to as a "transitional fossil," had both bird-like features 
            (such as feathers and a wishbone) and reptilian features (such as teeth and a long, bony tail), 
            providing early evidence of the link between dinosaurs and birds.
        </p>
        <p>In recent years, even large theropod 
            dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex have been found to have had feathers or feather-like structures during certain 
            stages of their development. This challenges the popular image of these dinosaurs as completely scaled. 
            The presence of feathers in large theropods suggests that feathers were likely widespread among dinosaurs 
            and may have served various functions beyond flight.

        <h2>Wishbones</h2>
        <p>
            The wishbone, scientifically known as the furcula, is a unique bone found in birds that plays a crucial 
            role in their flight apparatus. The wishbone is formed by the fusion of the clavicles (collar bones) in birds,
            creating a V-shaped structure located between the sternum and the shoulder joints. The wishbone serves as a
             site for the attachment of flight muscles and helps to stabilize the shoulder joint during flight movements.
