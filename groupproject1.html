            <p>Dinosaurs were a diverse group of reptiles that lived millions of years ago during the Mesozoic Era, which is often referred to as the "Age of Dinosaurs." They first appeared about 230 million years ago and became extinct around 65 million years ago.</p>

            <h2>Types of Dinosaurs</h2>
            There were many different types of dinosaurs, ranging from small, bird-like creatures to giant, long-necked sauropods and fearsome carnivores like Tyrannosaurus rex. There are two main groups of dinosaurs: Saruschia and Ornithischia.
            <ul>
                <li>Saurischia: These dinosaurs had lizard-like hips and include two main types:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Theropods: They were mostly meat-eaters, like T. Rex and Velociraptor.</li>
                        <li>Sauropodomorphs: These were the long-necked, plant-eating dinosaurs, like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Ornithischia: These dinosaurs had hips that looked more like those of birds and include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spiky Ones: They had body armor, like Stegosaurus and Ankylosaurus.</li>
                        <li>Horned Ones: They had frills or horns on their heads, like Triceratops.</li>
                        <li>Duck-Billed Ones: They were mostly plant-eaters and often had duck-like bills, like Iguanodon and Parasaurolophus.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <h2>Dinosaur Sizes</h2>
            Dinosaurs came in various sizes. Some were as small as chickens, while others, like the long-necked sauropods, could grow to lengths exceeding 100 feet and weigh many tons.

            <h2>Dinosaur Diet</h2>
            Dinosaurs had diverse diets. Some were carnivores, preying on other animals, while others were herbivores, feeding on plants. Some were omnivores, eating both plants and animals.

            <h2>Dinosaur Extinction</h2>
            While the exact cause of their extinction remains a topic of debate among scientists, most agree that a combination of factors, including volcanic activity, asteroid impact, and climate change, likely played a role in their demise around 65 million years ago.

            <h2>Dinosaur Fossils</h2>
            Our understanding of dinosaurs comes from the study of fossils, which are the preserved remains or traces of ancient organisms. Fossils provide clues about dinosaur anatomy, behavior, and ecology.
